# - ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tatwona McGuire. I am a aspiring software engineer and designer. Currently I am a student finishing my Software Engineering degree with Western Governors University. Listed in this repository are some of my repository Branches are some of the projects that I have created throughout my student career that I would love to share with you. A few shown here are my Pride and joy that you can find in my Professional Portfolio such as the HarvestHub app that I created for a non profit organization to help farmers and their local consumers connect with resources, organizations as well as with eachother for direct farm to consumer transactions. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in loads of things! right now my biggest interest as of late as far as career wise, has been application and web design as far as front-end goes. I love being creative and though it is challenging I am always looking for ways to increase my knowledge and creativity to build beautiful, accessible and functional user interfaces. 
- ðŸŒ± Other than studeious duties, Iâ€™m currently learning how to speak Korean! Its a fun and beautiful language to learn and my brain tells me it'd be nice to have a bit of an edge career wise.
