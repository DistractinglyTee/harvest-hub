Hiya 
My name is Tatwona McGuire and I am a software engineer and designer. 
HarvestHub is a mobile application that I created for a non profit organization that specializes in relieving food disparities, and insecurities in communities where these are highly prevalent. The organization focuses on connecting farmers of all backgrounds, and assisting them in getting over the hurdles of raciial, and identity disparities and alieviating the challenges that they are faced with by providing them with funding, and other resources and information.

The application that I have created allows farmers to do these things through the app. Farmers as well aas your average consumer are able to access resources such as funding, education, workshops, agricultural news etc through the app. The application also has ecommerce features that allows local farmer to sell direct to consumer, their products which creates another avenue for financial stability to local farmers, and food security to local consumers. 

I worked on this project for upwards of 6-7 months. It was the first major project that I worked on as a student and was successful with my hard work and diligence. This project has been my pride and joy!
